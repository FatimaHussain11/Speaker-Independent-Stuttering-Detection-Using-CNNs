<h3 align="center">AI-Powered Speech Stuttering Detection System</h3>

<p align="center">
An intelligent full-stack web application that analyzes speech recordings and detects whether the speech is <strong>Fluent</strong> or <strong>Stuttered</strong> using Machine Learning.
</p>

<p align="center">
<strong>SpeakFlow AI</strong> is an AI-powered web app that detects speech stuttering using MFCC feature extraction and a Random Forest classifier, providing confidence and fluency scores for uploaded or recorded audio. Built with Flask, Scikit-learn, and Librosa, it also includes user authentication, an admin dashboard, and PDF/CSV export features.

## 📖 Overview

SpeakFlow AI is an AI-powered speech analysis platform that classifies uploaded or recorded speech as **Fluent Speech** or **Stuttered Speech**.

The system extracts **Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs)** from speech audio and uses a trained **Random Forest Machine Learning model** to predict speech fluency with confidence scores.

This project was developed as an academic Machine Learning project for the **Bachelor of Software Engineering** program at **The University of Faisalabad**.

## ⚙ How It Works

1. User uploads or records speech.
2. Audio is preprocessed.
3. MFCC features are extracted using Librosa.
4. Features are passed to the trained Random Forest model.
5. The system predicts:
   - ✅ Fluent Speech
   - ⚠ Stuttered Speech
6. Confidence score and fluency score are displayed.
7. The result can be downloaded as a PDF report.

## 📂 Dataset

This model was trained using publicly available speech datasets collected from multiple sources.

### 🗣 Stuttering Speech Dataset

**UCLASS Stuttered Speech Clips (SEP-28k Format)**

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vudominhgiang/uclass-stuttered-speech-clips-sep-28k-format

### 🎤 Fluent Speech Dataset

**Mozilla Common Voice**

https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/

The datasets were preprocessed and combined to create a binary classification dataset for distinguishing between **Fluent Speech** and **Stuttered Speech**.

> **Note:** The datasets are **not included** in this repository. Please obtain them from their official sources and comply with their respective licenses before use.
